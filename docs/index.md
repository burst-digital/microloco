# General

## What Microloco is

Microloco aims to be a small internationalization library without bloat. Its focus lies on managing localized translations including interpolation and pluralization. 

## What Microloco is not 

In order to keep Microloco small, the library does not contain any bloat, such as:

- Date and time
- Number and currency formatting

The reason for this is simply because there are other libraries that handle these matters way more effectively, such as `moment` for dates and times and `numeral` for number & currency formatting.

## When to use Microloco

Use microloco when you need a barebones solution to translating your JavaScript or TypeScript applications with the possibility to extend functionality with other libraries through interpolation.
