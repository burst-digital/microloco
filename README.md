# Microloco

Microloco is a micro-sized Javascript/Typescript internationalization library so small it's **loco**.

This library aims to make internationalization easy with as little configuration needed as possible. 

It includes **interpolation** and **pluralization** support based on translations in defined **JSON** files or object literals.

- [Documentation](docs/index.md)
- [Example](example)
